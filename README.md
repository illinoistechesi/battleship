## Ship Class

### Initial Ship Properties

You have a total of 10 points to distribute amongst the four properties. These methods must be called in the constructor of the ship class.

#### initializeName(String name)
- String name: String name of your ship
- Returns: void

#### initializeOwner(String owner)
- String owner: String name of the person who created the ship
- Returns: void

#### initializeHull(int hull)
- int hull: The number of hits a ship can sustain.
- Returns: void

#### initializeFirepower(int firepower)
- int firepower: The number of shots a ship can make in a turn.
- Returns: void

#### initializeSpeed(int speed)
- int speed: The number of spaces the ship can move on a turn, movement is limited to NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST.
- Returns: void

#### initializeRange(int range)
- int range: The (squared) radius in which a ship can fire at.
- Returns: void

``` java
public class SampleShip extends Ship {
    // constructor method are called once when a new object is instantiated(created)
    public SampleShip() {
        this.initializeName("Boaty McBoatFace");
        this.initializeOwner("Nick");
        // 10 points to distribute among the methods below
        this.initializeHull(2);
        this.initializeFirepower(3);
        this.initializeSpeed(2);
        this.initializeRange(3);
    }
}
```

### Ship Actions
#### Protected Methods
These methods can only be called by the ship they belong to.

#### doTurn(Arena arena);
The code you put this method will be run each turn to instruct ship behavior. Use data from the battlefield given by the Arena object to perform different actions.

- Arena arena: Arena object used to get battlefield information
- Returns: void

``` java
@override
protected void doTurn(Arena arena) {
    // instruction for ship behavior here
}
```

#### move(Arena arena, Direction direction)
Move ship in a give direction if there are remaining moves available, the spot is not taken by another ship or considered outside of the game boundary.

- Arena arena: arena for the game; can be used to get battlefield information
- Direction direction: direction to move in (NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST)
- Returns: void

``` java
@override
protected void doTurn(Arena arena) {
    // instruction for ship behavior here
    int numMoves = this.getRemainingMoves();

    while(numMoves > 0) {
        // move north, west until there's only one turn left
        this.move(arena, Direction.NORTH);
        this.move(arena, Direction.WEST);
        // update the number of turn remaining
        numMoves = this.getRemainingMoves();
    }
    this.move(arena, Direction.EAST);
}
```

#### fire(Arena arena, int x, int y)
Fire at given coordinates if there are remaining shots available.
- Arena arena: arena for the game
- int x: x coordinate to fire at
- int y: y coordinate to fire at
- Returns: void

``` java
@override
protected void doTurn(Arena arena) {
    // instruction for ship behavior here
    this.fire(arena, 1, 3);

    // get a list of nearby ships
    List<Ship> targets = this.getNearbyShips(arena);
    // access the list if there are any nearby ships
    if (targets.size() > 0) {
        // get the first ship in the targets list
        Ship ship = targets.get(0);
        Coord location = ship.getCoord();
        int x = location.getX();
        int y = location.getY();
        this.fire(arena, x, y);
    }
}
```

#### Public Methods
These methods can be called on any ship.

#### [Deprecated] ~~getShipCoord(Arena arena, Ship ship)~~
Get the coordinates of another ship if it is within the range of your ship.
- **Note:** You do not have to use this method because you can now get the coordinates of any ship, even if it is outside the range of your ship.
- Arena arena: takes an arena object
- Ship ship: another ship
- Returns: Coord


#### getNearbyShips(Arena arena)
Returns a list of ships (exclusing your own) that are within the range of your ship.
- Arena arena: takes an arena object
- Returns: List<Ship>

> Q: "What do the angle brackets mean?"

> A: These are called "generics." You can use Lists to store any kind of object. So the way to read `List<Ship>` out loud is: "a List of Ship objects."

``` java
@override
protected void doTurn(Arena arena) {
    // instruction for ship behavior here
    this.fire(arena, 1, 3);

    // get a list of nearby ships
    List<Ship> targets = this.getNearbyShips(arena);

    // loop over all nearby ships
    for (int index = 0; index < targets.size(); index += 1) {
        Ship shipInfo = targets.get(index);
        System.out.println("One nearby ship has " + shipInfo.getHealth() + " HP left.");
    }

    System.out.println("There are " + targets.size() + " number of nearby ships");

    // if there is atleast one nearby ships
    if (targets.size() > 0) {
        // get the first ship in the list
        Ship first = targets.get(0);
        // get the fourth ship in the list
        Ship fourth = targets.get(0);
    }
}
```

### Methods that can be used on any ship

#### getCoord()
Get the coordinate of your ship, check out the Coord class for more information.
- **Note:** You can now get the coordinates of any ship, even if it is outside the range of your ship.
- Returns: Coord

**Example of getting x and y from Coord object**
``` java
Coord coord = this.getCoord():
int x = coord.getX();
int y = coord.getY();
System.out.println("My ship is at (" + x + ", " + y + ").");
```

#### isSameTeamAs(Ship other)
Check if another ship is on the same team as the ship calling this method.
- Ship other: another ship to compare
- Returns: boolean

**Example of checking if a ship is on your team:**
``` java
List<Ship> nearby = this.getNearbyShips(arena);
for (int i = 0; i < nearby.size(); i++) {
    Ship other = nearby.get(i);
    boolean isOnMyTeam = this.isSameTeamAs(other);
    if (isOnMyTeam) {
        System.out.println("This ship is on my team!");
    } else {
        System.out.println("This ship is an enemy.");
    }
}
```
**Example of checking if two different ships are on the same team as each other:**
``` java
Ship first = nearby.get(0);
Ship second = nearby.get(1);
if (first.isSameTeamAs(second)) {
    System.out.println("These two ships are conspiring with each other.");
} else {
    System.out.println("These two ships are not friends with each other.");
}
```

#### getRemainingMoves()

**Example Usage:**
``` java
List<Ship> list = this.getNearbyShips(arena);
Ship enemy = list.get(0);
System.out.println("Enemy Ship: " + enemy.getName());
System.out.println("Firepower: " + enemy.getFirepower());

if (enemy.getSpeed() > this.getSpeed()) {
    System.out.println("The enemy ship will move before my ship.");
} else if (enemy.getSpeed() > this.getSpeed()) {
    System.out.println("The enemy ship will move after my ship.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The enemy ship might move before or after my ship.");
}

int hitsTaken = enemy.getHull() - enemy.getHealth();
System.out.println("Enemy has taken " + hitsTaken + " hits.");
```

## Arena Class

#### getAllShips()

// then we have reached the EAST edge of the map
if (myShipLocation.getX() + 1 == arena.getXSize()) {
    this.move(arena, Direction.WEST);
}
// similar example but uses y location and a variable to store the values
int shipYLocation = myShipLocation.getY();
// if current y location minus one is equal to zero
// then we have reached the NORTH edge of the map
if (shipYLocation - 1 == 0) {
    this.move(arena, Direction.SOUTH);
}
```

#### getTurn()
Get the number of this turn.
- Returns: int

#### countLiveShips()

int i = arena.getRandom().nextInt(4);
```
``` java

    // your implementation of a ship

    // gets the current location of the ship
    Coord coord = this.getCoord();
    int x = coord.getX();
    int y = coord.getY();

    if (x > 8) {
        this.move(arena, Direction.WEST);
    }
    else if (x < 2) {
        this.move(arena, Direction.EAST);
    }
    else if (y > 8) {
        this.move(arena, Direction.NORTH);
    }
    else if (y < 2) {
        this.move(arena, Direction.SOUTH);
    }
    else {
        // make a list of all the location, and store it in a variable
        Direction[] possibleMovement = {Direction.NORTH, Direction.SOUTH, Direction.WEST, Direction.EAST};

        // get a random number and store it in a variable
        int randomNumber = arena.getRandom().nextInt(4)

        // get a random movement by using the random number to access one possibleMovement
        this.move(arena, possibleMovement[randomNumber]);
    }

    // ship using this instruction will fire at location (x: 0, y: 0) each turn
    this.fire(arena, 0, 0);
}
```
